# BFI-2 Analysis Assignment

# Overview This project focuses on analyzing the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) data using Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA).
The primary goal is to explore the structure of BFI-2 at different times and among various age groups, comparing different algorithms to gain insights into personality trait structures.

**Sections:**

-   Structure of BFI-2 at Time 1

    -   Subset Data for Time 1 Analysis

-   Comparing Walktrap and Louvain Algorithms

    -   Application of EGA and Louvain Algorithm to Time 1 Data

    -   Analysis of Communities, Lambda, Edges, Edge Density, and TEFI

-   Age Group Analysis

    -   Data Split by Age Groups (Younger and Middle-aged)

    -   EGA Application for Different Age Groups

    -   Visual Comparison of EGA Results between Age Groups
