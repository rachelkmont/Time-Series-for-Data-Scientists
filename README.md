# Time-Series-for-Data-Scientists

This repository covers assignments from my advanced statistics course during my Master's program for data science at Vanderbilt University. 

*Motivation* 

Predicting future outcomes is fundamental to human activity. Understanding how past events lead to current conditions can enable us to make predictions about the future. These projects will focus on how we can predictions about the future based on past evidence. Applied uses include forecasting market outcomes (e.g., stocks, company earnings) tohuman behavior (e.g., emotions, public health policy).

*Overview of Projects*

The goal of these time series forecasting projects is to use past performance patterns to make predictions about the future. Key topics in this component includes regression,
decomposition, smoothing, ARIMA models, and dynamic covariation. A second component will focus on applying dimension reduction techniques such as exploratory graph analysis (EGA) to
survey data. A third component of this course will focus on A/B testing (also referred to as experimental design). In this component, weâ€™ll cover how we can manipulate different features
of the stimulus/environment to uncover predictions about behavior.
