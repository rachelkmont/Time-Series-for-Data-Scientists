# BFI-2 Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) survey data, focusing on the structural invariance and redundancy across different times and age groups.
The analysis aims to understand how survey responses vary over time and between younger and middle-aged groups, providing insights into the consistency and reliability of the BFI-2 survey.

In this assignment, we delve into the robustness of the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) dataset using Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA). We aim to investigate measurement invariance across different times and age groups, and identify any redundancies in the survey data.

**Sections:**

-   Data Preparation and Grouping

    -   Subsetting the data for Time 1 and Time 2.

    -   Segmenting into younger and middle-aged groups.

    -   Setting up the theoretical structure.

-   Invariance Analysis Across Survey Times

    -   Testing invariance in the younger age group.

    -   Testing invariance in the middle-aged age group.

-   Comparative Invariance Study Between Age Groups

    -   Performing invariance analysis between age groups at Time 1.

    -   Summarizing key invariant measurements.
