# Forecasting Decomposition

## Overview

This project is a practical guide to understanding forecasting decomposition, focusing on breaking down complex time series data into fundamental components like trend, seasonality, and residuals. The assignment uses real-world datasets, including gas production data and emotional research data, to demonstrate these concepts using R.

**Sections:**

1.  **Gas Production Data Analysis:** This section starts by examining the last five years of gas production data. It includes data loading, time series plotting to identify trends and seasonality, and decomposition using the Seasonal-Trend Loess (STL) method. The focus is on interpreting the decomposition results, computing seasonally adjusted data, and exploring the effects of outliers on the series.

2.  **Emotion Research Forecasting:** The second section shifts to forecasting emotions based on data from a research study. The process includes visualizing the data, fitting a linear model to forecast the level of worry, and comparing forecasts using different methods, such as data generated by ChatGPT and randomly generated data. The section concludes with an evaluation of the forecasts using accuracy measures like RMSE and MAE.
